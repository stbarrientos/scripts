Anatomy: switch to the home directory for the path to be set correctly. Check to see if the scripts directory exists, if it doesn't, create it. Check to see if a file named appender_script.sh exists in the scricpts directory, if it does, replace it, if it doesn't create it. Curl the info at the github page and save it into appender_script.sh, append the Path variable to the bash profile to allow the script to run, modify permisions for the script, run the script
